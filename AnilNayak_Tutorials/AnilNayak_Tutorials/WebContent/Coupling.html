	<ul>
	  <li>The degree of dependency between the components is called coupling . </li>
	  <li>Dependency between the components should be less as possible . </li>
	</ul>
	<textarea rows="10" cols="80" style="color: blue;">
	  Example: 
	      class A { 
	         static int i = 10;
	      }
	      class B { 
	         static int j = C.m1();
	      }
	      class C { 
	        
	        public static int m1(){ 
	          return D.k;
	        }
	      }
	      class D { 
	         static int k =190;
	      }
	      
	      Note :  The above components are said to be tightly coupled with each other. 
	           Because the dependency between the components is high . 
	</textarea>
	<ul>
	  <li>Tightly coupling is not a good programing practice, because it has several disadvantages . 
	      <ul>
	        <li>Without effecting remaining components we can not modify any component . Hence enhancement will become difficult . </li>
	        <li>It reduces maintainbility of the application . </li>
	        <li>It does not promots reusability . </li>
	      </ul>
	 </li>
	 <li>Loose coupling is always good programing parctice . </li>
	</ul>
	<h5>
       <b style="color: green ">Cohesion : </b>
	</h5>
	<ul>
	  <li>For every component we have to define a clear well defined functionality, such type of component is said to be follow high cohesion . </li>
	</ul>
	<img alt="" src="images/cohession.PNG" />
	<ul>
	 <li>High cohesion is always recommonded. Because it has the following advantages. 
	    <ul>
	     <li>Without effecting remaining components we can modify any components . Hence enhancement will become easy . </li>
	     <li>It improves maintainbility of the application . </li>
	     <li>It promotes reusability( Whenever validation is required we can reuse the same Validation component everywhere without rewriting again . )</li>
	     <li>High cohesion and loose coupling ar good programing practice . </li>     
	    </ul>
	 </li>
	</ul>
