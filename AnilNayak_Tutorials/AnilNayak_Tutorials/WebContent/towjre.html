	<h4>
		<b style="color: green;">Why two JRE in Java</b>
	</h4>
	When we install java, check the installation locations as I shown below screen shots
	<br><br>
	<img alt="" src="images/T1.PNG"/><br><br>
	<img alt="" src="images/T2.PNG"/><br><br>
	As you can see there is two jre, one is outside jdk and another is inside jdk.
	So why is it like that ,actually to run any compiled java class we need only <b>JRE</b> .
	But to both for developing java class, compiling and executing we need <b>JDK</b> and <b>JRE</b> .
	So when any non-developer people only wants to run only compiled java class, then outside jdk 'JRE' is
	sufficient.But wnen we wants both development and executions of java class, then we need both <b>JDK</b>
	and <b>JRE</b> .
