     <ul>
       <li>In old languages like C++, programmer responsible for  both creation and destruction of Objects . </li>
       <li>Usually the programmer taking very much care while creating objects and neglecting destruction of useless objects .  </li>
       <li>Due to this neglectance at certain point for creation of new objects sufficient memory may not be available and entire application will be crashed due to memory problems . </li>
       <li>Hence OutOfMemoryError is very common problem in old languages like C++ . </li>
       <li>But in Java programmer is responsible only for creation of Objects and is not responsible for destruction of useless objects . </li>
       <li>SUN people provided one assistant which is always running in the background for destruction of useless objects . </li>
       <li>Just because of this assistant the chance of failing Java program is very less because of memory problems. This assistant is nothing but Garbage Collector . </li>
       <li>Hence the main objective of Garbage Collector is to destroy useless objects . </li>
     </ul>
