     <ul>
       <li>Sometimes we can declare a class inside another class such type of classes are called Inner classes. </li>
       <li>Inner classes concept introduced in 1.1 version to fix GUI bugs as the part of Event Handling . </li>
       <li>But because of powerful features  and benefits of Inner classes slowly programmers are started using in regular coding also . </li>
       <li>Without existing one type of object if there is no chance of existing another type of object then we should go for inner classes .</li>
     </ul>

	    Example 1: University consist of several departments . Without existing University there is no chance of existing department . 
	          Hence Department is the part of University and we have to declare Department class inside University class. 
	          class University { 
	             class Department { 
	                
	             }
	          }
	    
	    Example 2: Without existing Bank object there is no chance of existing Account object .
	               Hence we have to declare Account class inside Bank class . 
	               class Bank { 
	                  class Account { 
	                  
	                  }
	               }
	    
	    Example 3: Map is a collection of key and value pairs and each key value pair is called an Entry . 
	               Hence Map is considered as Collection of Entry objects . Without existing Entry object there is chance of existing Map object . Hence interface Entry is defined inside Map interface
	               
	               interface Map { 
	                  interface Entry { 
	                  
	                  }
	               }

	<ul>
	  <li>Note: Without existing Outer class object there is no chance of existing Inner class object . </li>
	  <li>The relationship between Outer class and Inner class is not parent to child relationship . It is Has-A relationship(Composition/Aggregation)</li>
	  <li>Based on purpose and position of declaration all Inner classes are devided into 4 types 
	     <ul>
	       <li>Normal or Regular Inner classes</li>
	       <li>Method Local Inner classes</li>
	       <li>Anonymous Inner classes </li>
	       <li>Static Nested classes</li>
	     </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>
