	</h4>
	<ul>
	 <li><b>Simple:</b> Java is easy to learn. It does not include concepts of pointers and operator overloading that were available in C++.</li>
	 <li><b>Object Oriented:</b> You can model everything into an object which has data and behavior. Java has incorporated various object-oriented concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and inheritance.</li>
	 <li><b>Platform independence:</b>  Java is write-once, run-anywhere language. Once you compile java code, you can run it on any machine. For example: If you compile your code on Windows OS, you can easily run the same bytecode in linux.</li>
	 <li><b>Portable:</b> Java byte can be portable to any platform and can be executed on any platform.</li>
	 <li><b>Multi-threading:</b> Java has provided multithreading feature which will help you to execute various task in parallel. It has introduced executor framework which is more robust and easy to use.</li>
	 <li><b>High performance:</b> Java can not be as fast as C and C++ as it is interpreted language but it has provided various features such as Just in time compiler to increase performance.</li>
