	<ul>
	  <li>It is also known as Composition or Aggregation . </li>
	  <li>There is no specific keyword to implement HAS-A relationship. But, mostly we can use new operator . </li>
	  <li>The advantage is reusability . </li>
	</ul>
	<textarea rows="10" cols="60" style="color: blue;">
	  Example: 
	  class Car { 
	     Engine e = new Engine();
	  }
	  
	  class Engine { 
	    // Engine Specific Functionalityy
	  }
	  
	  Note: class Car HAS-A Engine reference .

	<ul>
	  <li>The main advantages of HAS-A-Relationship is reusability. But the main advantages is it increases dependency between the components and it effects maintainability .  </li>

       <b style="color: green ">Composition vs Aggregation:</b>
	</h4>
	
	<h4>
       <b style="color: green ">Composition : </b>
	</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>Without existing container object if there is no chance of existing contained objects, then these container and contained objects are strongly associated and this strong association is called as composition . </li>
	</ul>
	  <b>Example:</b> A university consists of several departments. Without existing University there is no chance of existing Department . Hence University and Department objects are strongly associated and this relationship is nothing but Composition . 
	<h4>
       <b style="color: green ">Aggregation : </b>
	</h4>
	<ul>
	 <li>Without existing of Container object there may be a chance of existing Contained Objects, then Container and Contained objects are weekly associated, which is called Aggregation. </li>
	</ul>
	   <b>Example:</b> Within a University there are several Professors . Without existing of Department Object there may be a chance of existing of Professors . Hence Department and Professors Objects are weakly associated, which is nothing but Aggregation .<br>
	   Note: In composition, Objects are strongly associated, where as in Aggregation, Objects are weakly associated . <br>
	 <textarea rows="10" cols="100" style="color: blue;">
	  Example: 
	   class Student { 
	        String studentName;
	        static String collegeName = "SalepurCollege";
	   }
	  Note 1: Without existing of Student Object there is no chance of existing of "studentName", hence the relationship between Student and studentName is Composition (Strong Association).
	  Note 2: Without existing of Student there may be a chance of existing "collegeName", hence the relationship between Student and collegeName is Aggregation(Weak Association) .
