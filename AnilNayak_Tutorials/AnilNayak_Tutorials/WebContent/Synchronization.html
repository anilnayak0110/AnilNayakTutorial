   <h4>
       <b style="color: green ">Synchronization:</b>
	</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>Synchronized is the keyword applicable for methods and blocks, but not for classes and variables . </li>
	  <li>If a method or block declared as synchronized then at a time only one thread is allowed to execute on the given object, so that data inconsistency problem will be solved . </li>
	  <li>The main advantage of synchronized keyword is we can overcome data inconsistency problems . </li>
	  <li>But the main disadvantage of synchronized keyword is it increases waiting time of threads and performance will be reduced . </li>
	  <li>Hence if there is no specific requirement then it is never recommended to use synchronized keyword . </li>
	  <li>Every object in java has a unique lock . </li>
	  <li>Internally synchronization concept is implemented by using lock concept . </li>
	  <li>Whenever we are using synchronization concept is implemented by using lock concept . </li>
	  <li>If a thread wants to execute a synchronized method on the given object first it has to get lock of that object . </li>
	  <li>Once synchronized method execution completes thread releases the lock automatically . </li>
	  <li>Acquiring and releasing the lock takes care by JVM automatically and programmer is not responsible for these things . </li>
	  <li>While a thread executing synchronized method on the given object the remaining threads are not allowed to execute any synchronized method on that object simultaneously . </li>
	  <li>But remaining threads are allowed to execute any non-synchronized methods simultaneously . </li>

	    Example: 
	             class Dispaly { 
	                public synchronized void wish(String name){ 
	                    for(int i=0;i<=10;i++){ 
	                       System.out.println("God Bless you :"+name);
	                       try{ 
	                         Thread.sleep(1000);
	                       }
	                       catch(InterruptedException ie){ 
	                          System.out.println(name);
	                       }
	                    }
	                }
	             }
	             
	             class MyThread extends Thread{ 
	                  Display d;
	                  String name;

	                  public void run(){

	<ul>
	  <li>If we are not declaring wish(-) method as synchronized then at a time both thread will be executed simultaneously and hence we will get irregular output .</li>
	  <li>Since we declared wish(-) method as synchronized then at a time only one thread is allowed to execute on the given Display object . </li>
	</ul>
	<textarea rows="15" cols="80" style="color: blue;">
	   Case Study :
	   
	          Display d1 = new Display();
	          Display d2 = new Display();
	          
	          MyThread g = new MyThread(d1,"Gayatree");
	          MyThread a = new MyThread(d2,"Anil");
	          g.start();
	          a.start();
	          
	         Note: In this case eventhough wish(-) method is synchronized still we will get irregular output because threads are operating on different objects . 
	</textarea>
	<ul>
	  <li>If multiple threads are operating on different objects then there is no impact of synchronized keyword . </li>
	  <li>But if multiple threads are operating on same java object then there is impact of synchronized keyword . </li>
	</ul>
	 <h5>
       <b style="color: green ">Class level lock </b>
	</h5>
	<ul>
	  <li>Every class in Java has a unique lock which is also known as a class level lock . </li>
	  <li>If a thread wants to execute static synchronized method then it has to get class level lock . </li>
	  <li>Once thread got class level lock then it is allowed to execute any static synchronized method . </li>
	  <li>While a thread executing any static synchronized method then remaining threads are not allowed to execute any static synchronized methods simultaneously . </li>
	  <li>But remaining threads are allowed to execute the following methods simultaneously . 
	      <ul>
	        <li>Normal static methods </li>
	        <li>Normal synchronized methods </li>
	        <li>Normal instance methods</li>
	      </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	 <h5>
       <b style="color: green ">Synchronized Block :</b>
	</h5>
	<ul>
	  <li>If very few lines of the code requires synchronization then it is never recommended to declare entire method as synchronized . 
	      We have to enclose those few lines of the code with synchronized block . 
	  </li>
	  <li>The main advantages of synchronized block over synchronized method is waiting time of thread will reduced . So that performance will be improved . </li>
	  <li>We can use declare synchronized block as follows . 
	     <ul>
	       <li>To get lock of current object :<br>
	             synchronized(this){ <br>
	             }
	       </li>
	       <li>
	           To get lock of a particular object 'b':<br>
	           synchronized(b){ <br>
	           
	           }
	       </li>
	       <li>
	            To get lock of Display class (class level lock)<br>
	            synchronized(Display.class){<br>
	            
	            }
	       </li>
	       <li>Note: Lock concept applicable only for objects and classes but not for primitives . Hence we can pass either object reference or class name as argument to synchronized block , but not primitives otherwise we will get compile time error . <br>
	               int x = 10;<br>
	               synchronized(x){<br>
	               
	               }<br>
	               CE: unexpected type <br>
